## Good things about BayConstitute

### 1. Easy to edit!
All you need to do is go to https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/432505083/, click 'Remix', edit the project, then convert to .html at https://sheeptester.github.io/htmlifier/!
### 2. Open sourced!
Use the instructions above to make your edit of BayConstitute!
### 3. Better than a wall!
You can't play a wall, but you can play BayConstitute!

## DO NOT
-Edit the straight code, it contains the project and the Scratch Launcher, both of which could get broken easily!

-Make any innapropriate things, it ruins the game and is not the way you want to go!
